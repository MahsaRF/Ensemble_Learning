# Ensemble Learning

•	Utilized the Scikit-Learn unified meta-estimators for Bagging and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) to combine the predictions of several base estimators built with a given learning algorithm (decision tree classifier and Support Vector Classification) and improved generalizability and robustness over a single estimator 

•	Performed the classification on Ionosphere dataset using K-fold cross-validation, demonstrated the test and train error rates as K changes and determined optimal Ensemble Learning Strategy in terms of the components of the error (bias/variance) and overfitting/underfitting
